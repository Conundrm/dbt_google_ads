# Decision Log
## Ads Associated with Multiple Ad Groups
It was discovered within the `google_ads.ads_stats` source table that a single Ad can be associated with multiple ad groups on any given day. Because of this, it was determined that the `is_most_recent_record` logic within the `stg_google_ads__ad_history` model needed to account for the `ad_group_id` as well as the individual `ad_id`. As a result, the most recent record of an ad could possibly contain a unique combination of the `ad_id` and the `ad_group_id`.

The final `google_ads__utm_report` and `google_ads__ad_report` models also take this into account and include an addition join condition between the `stg_google__ad_stats` and `stg_google__ad_history` models to account for the varying grain of the ad -> ad group relationship within the two tables. This additional join condition ensures the final models are accurately capturing **all** metrics for the ads that are associated with multiple ad groups.

This logic was only applied to the `google_ads__utm_report` and `google_ads__ad_report` models as it was discovered this relationship was unique to ads and ad groups. If you experience this relationship among any of the other ad hierarchies, please open and [issue](https://github.com/fivetran/dbt_google_ads/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug%2Ctriage&template=bug-report.yml&title=%5BBug%5D+%3Ctitle%3E) and we can continue the discussion!
